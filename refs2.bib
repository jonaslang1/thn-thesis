  abstract = {The digital versatile disk (DVD), an emerging standard of optical storage, provides a higher capacity than audio CD, CD-ROM or video CD (VCD). To mitigate the errors introduced during manufacturing or by user damage, a Reed-Solomon Product-Code (RS-PC) is used in DVD for error correction. For this application, the authors present an RS-PC decoder chip with a dual-frame-buffer architecture. The decoder chip contains two frame buffer controllers that interface with two off-chip frame buffers, a (182,172) row RS decoder and a (208,192) column RS decoder. The chip uses a cell library in a 0.6 /spl mu/m SPDM CMOS process. The 99-pin chip is packaged in a 100 LDCQFP package, where 48 pins are for frame buffer interface and can be eliminated with embedded frame buffers. The row and column RS decoders work at 33 MHz with a 3 V supply. The RS-PC decoder is currently limited in speed by the off-chip frame buffer to about 18 MHz. The power dissipation is 102 mW at 33 MHz.},

  abstract = {Constructing Reed--Solomon (RS) codes that can correct insertions and deletions (insdel errors) has been considered in numerous recent works. Our focus in this paper is on the special case of two-dimensional RS-codes that can correct from n-3 insdel errors, the maximal possible number of insdel errors a two-dimensional linear code can recover from. It is known that an [n], [2]\textsubscript{q} RS-code that can correct from n-3 insdel errors satisfies that q={\O}mega (n{\textasciicircum}3) . On the other hand, there are several known constructions of [n], [2]\textsubscript{q} RS-codes that can correct from n-3 insdel errors, where the smallest field size is q=O(n{\textasciicircum}4) . In this short paper, we construct [n], [2]\textsubscript{q} Reed--Solomon codes that can correct n-3 insdel errors with q=O(n{\textasciicircum}3) , thereby resolving the minimum field size needed for such codes.},

  abstract = {Error-Correcting Codes, by Professor Peterson, was originally published in 1961. Now, with E. J. Weldon, Jr., as his coauthor, Professor Peterson has extensively rewritten his material. The book contains essentially all of the material of the first edition; however, the authors state that because there has been so much new work published in error-correcting codes, the preparation of this second edition proved to be a much greater task than writing the original book. The major additions are the chapters on majority-logic codes, synchronization, and convolutional codes. Much new material has also been added to the chapters on important linear block codes and cyclic codes. The authors cite some highly regarded books on recent work done in Eastern Europe and an extensive bibliography on coding theory in the Soviet Union [sic]. In its much-expanded form, Error-Correcting Codes may be considered another valuable contribution to computer coding.},

The results can be generalized to arbitrary number fields.},
