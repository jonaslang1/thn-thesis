  abstract = {In digital communication, errors are introduced during the transmission of data from the transmitter to receiver due to noise or environmental interference. Hence, we have to use some kind of error control coding for error detection and error correction. In this paper we are applying error control mechanisms, like hamming code, BCH codes and reed Solomon codes to detect and correct the errors. Thus we are used Hamming code, ReedSolomon and BCH code control techniques to correct the errors. Lastly we are comparing the capability of error correcting those codes .the comparison is based on the strength of error correcting technique.},

To mitigate the errors introduced during manufacturing or by user damage, a Reed-Solomon Product-Code (RS-PC) is used in DVD for error correction. For this application, the authors present an RS-PC decoder chip with a dual-frame-buffer architecture. The decoder chip contains two frame buffer controllers that interface with two off-chip frame buffers, a (182,172) row RS decoder and a (208,192) column RS decoder. The chip uses a cell library in a 0.6 /spl mu/m SPDM CMOS process. The 99-pin chip is packaged in a 100 LDCQFP package, where 48 pins are for frame buffer interface and can be eliminated with embedded frame buffers. The row and column RS decoders work at 33 MHz with a 3 V supply. The RS-PC decoder is currently limited in speed by the off-chip frame buffer to about 18 MHz. The power dissipation is 102 mW at 33 MHz.},

The major competitors of this technology are Qualcomm's MediaFLO system, the 3G cellular system based MBMS mobile-TV standard, and the ATSC-M/H format in the U.S. DVB-SH (Satellite to Handhelds) now and DVB-NGH (Next Generation Handheld) in the future are possible enhancements to DVB-H, providing improved spectral efficiency and better modulation flexibility. DVB-H has been a commercial failure, and the service is no longer on-air. Ukraine was the last country with a nationwide broadcast in DVB-H, which began transitioning to DVB-T2 during 2019.},

  abstract = {A QR code (quick-response code) is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode, invented in 1994, by Japanese company Denso Wave for labelling automobile parts. A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, including some fiducial markers, which can be read by an imaging device, such as a camera, and processed using Reed--Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both the horizontal and the vertical components of the QR image. Whereas a barcode is a machine-readable optical image that contains information specific to the labelled item, the QR code contains the data for a locator, an identifier, and for web-tracking. To efficiently store data, QR codes use four standardized modes of encoding: (i) numeric, (ii) alphanumeric, (iii) byte or binary, and (iv) kanji. Compared to standard UPC barcodes, the QR labelling system was applied beyond the automobile industry because of faster reading of the optical image and greater data-storage capacity in applications such as product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.},

Recently, erasure codes have been used to reduce the large storage overhead of three-replicated systems. Reed-Solomon codes are the standard design choice and their high repair cost is often considered an unavoidable price to pay for high storage efficiency and high reliability. This paper shows how to overcome this limitation. We present a novel family of erasure codes that are efficiently repairable and offer higher reliability compared to Reed-Solomon codes. We show analytically that our codes are optimal on a recently identified tradeoff between locality and minimum distance. We implement our new codes in Hadoop HDFS and compare to a currently deployed HDFS module that uses Reed-Solomon codes. Our modified HDFS implementation shows a reduction of approximately 2{\texttimes} on the repair disk I/O and repair network traffic. The disadvantage of the new coding scheme is that it requires 14\% more storage compared to Reed-Solomon codes, an overhead shown to be information theoretically optimal to obtain locality. Because the new codes repair failures faster, this provides higher reliability, which is orders of magnitude higher compared to replication.},

  abstract = {Based on the BCH code, this thesis investigates how an BCH error correction approach can be combined with an additional detection of higher numbers of errors.  With the method of 1-bit correction with additional detection of higher errors, an approach is developed that performs the additional detection of higher errors by solving simple equations of the form s\_x = s\_1{\textasciicircum}x in parallel.  The number of these equations is in a linear relationship to the number of higher errors to be checked.  In this thesis, a generalization for such an approach is presented for up to 4-bit correction with additional detection of higher errors.  Therefore, a speculative error correction is carried out in parallel fashion for each correctable error count.  For each of the generated speculative error positions, a speculative syndrome is generated, which can be used to confirm the error positions and exclude detectable errors of higher number.  The presented approach differs from the approach developed in [Pet60], in which the number of errors is determined by calculating specific determinants in descending order until the first determinant is 0.  In the well-known method, the calculation of the determinants involves performing a factorial number of calculations in relation to the number of errors to be checked.  Compared to the well-known sequential method according to Berlekamp Massey [Ber68][Mas69], the calculations in the presented approach can be performed by solving simple equations and can be carried out in parallel.  In the well-known method for parallel correction of 4-bit errors, an equation of fourth degree in the GF(2{\textasciicircum}m) has to be solved.  This is done by solving a third-degree auxiliary equation and four second-degree equations in parallel.  In the present thesis it was shown that a second-degree equation can be saved, resulting in a simplification of the hardware for a parallel realization of the 4-bit correction.  The results obtained were verified by extensive simulations in software and hardware implementations.},

  abstract = {We study Reed-Solomon codes over arbitrary fields, inspired by several recent papers dealing with Gabidulin codes over fields of characteristic zero. Over the field of rational numbers, we derive bounds on the coefficient growth during encoding and the bit complexity of decoding, which is polynomial in the code length and in the bit width of error and codeword values. The results can be generalized to arbitrary number fields.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of simultaneous error-correction and burst-error detection using binary linear cyclic codes. For certain types of teletype channels, it pays to correct random errors and to detect bursts. It is shown that the burst-error detecting capability drops by one more than the length of the largest gap in the recursion polynomial when a binary linear cyclic code is used to correct single errors. Only special cases of this result are obtained for multiple-error-correction. The single-error result is applied to develop a new criterion for primitivity of polynomials over the two-element field. The criterion depends on the largest gap in the recursion polynomial corresponding to the polynomial to be tested for primitivity.},

QR code provides high data storage capacity, fast scanning, omnidirectional readability, and many other advantages including, error-correction (so that damaged code can also be read successfully) and different type of versions. Different varieties of QR code symbols like logo QR code, encrypted QR code, iQR Code are also available so that user can choose among them according to their need. Now these days, a QR code is applied in different application streams related to marketing, security, academics etc. and gain popularity at a really high pace. Day by day more people are getting aware of this technology and use it accordingly. The popularity of QR code grows rapidly with the growth of smartphone users and thus the QR code is rapidly arriving at high levels of acceptance worldwide.},
